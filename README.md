# Getting Started

This is Dragonscape Homepage - We are enthusiasts, and we are here to help you create a complete visual identity for your company. Websites, SEO, design â€“ that's our field! 
We decided to create our website in React, so we leave the door open for more advanced functionality in the future. The source code remain public.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.
